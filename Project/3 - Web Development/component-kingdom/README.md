# Component Kingdom — Build a UI from Blocks

### Overview

Build a small React page by breaking the UI into reusable components. 
The goal is to learn component-based development and how React UIs scale by composing smaller pieces.

### Requirements (Must Have)

1. Create a single-page UI with these sections:
   - Header (title + short subtitle)
   - Main content area
   - Sidebar (or info panel)
   - Footer
2. Create at least 5 components, for example:
   - Header
   - Footer
   - Sidebar
   - MainContent
   - Card (reused)
3. Component reuse requirement
   - Use one reusable component (ex: Card) at least 3 times with different content.
4. List rendering requirement
   - Use map() over an array to render repeated UI (ex: render cards from an array of objects).
5. Basic styling:
   - Simple CSS is fine, but the page must be readable (spacing, headings, alignment).
