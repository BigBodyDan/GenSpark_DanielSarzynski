# Hello React — The First Render

### Overview

Create a simple React app that renders a clean UI using JSX. This assignment is focused on understanding what React is, how JSX renders to the page, and how to organize a basic layout.

### Requirements (Must Have)

1. Create a React app and render a page with:
   - A title header
   - A short “about” paragraph
   - A list of 3–5 learning goals
2. Use JSX correctly:
   - At least 1 className
   - At least 1 expression inside { } (example: a variable, today’s date, a computed value)
3. Create at least 2 components:
   - App
   - One additional component (example: ProfileCard or GoalsList)
4. Keep the UI readable:
   - Basic spacing and styling (simple CSS is fine)
